We are given a file path: '/Downloads/datasetTexto.csv'
 We need to compute the exact proportion (percentage) of records for the 
categories:
   - "Generacion Z"
   - "Frankenstein"

 However, note that the question says "frente a", meaning we are comparing 
two categories.

 Steps:
 1. Read the dataset from the given CSV file.
 2. We assume that the dataset has a column that contains the categories 
(we don't know the exact column name, so we might need to look for the 
column that contains the string we are interested in).
 3. Since the question does not specify the column, we have to make an 
assumption. Let's assume the column is named 'category' or 'topic' or 
something similar. But the problem does not specify.

 However, note: the user's query is in Spanish and the dataset name is in 
English. We must be cautious.

 Let's re-read the question: it says "en el dataset", meaning the dataset 
provided. We don't know the structure.

 Since the problem does not specify the column, we must consider that the 
categories might be in a column that has the exact string "Generacion Z" 
or "Frankenstein". Alternatively, we might have to look for columns that 
are named in a way that matches.

 But note: the user might have provided the dataset and the categories are 
in a column named differently.

 Alternatively, the categories might be in the text itself (the content of 
the records) and we are to count the records that contain either of these 
strings.

 However, the question says "registros sobre", meaning records about these 
topics. This could be in the text column.

 Let's break down the possibilities:

 Option 1: The categories are in a specific column (like 'category') and 
we count the number of rows in that column that exactly equal "Generacion 
Z" and "Frankenstein".

 Option 2: The categories are in the text of the record (like a 'text' 
column) and we count the records that have the string "Generacion Z" or 
"Frankenstein".

 The problem does not specify, so we must ask for clarification. But since 
we are to provide a solution, we must choose one.

 Let's assume the categories are in a column named 'category'. This is a 
common practice.

 If the dataset does not have a column named 'category', then we might 
have to look for the text columns.

 However, the user's query is ambiguous.

 Since the problem says "¿Cuál es la proporción exacta de registros sobre 
...", and the word "sobre" in Spanish can mean "about", it is more likely 
that we are to look for the presence of the string in the text.

 But note: the word "exacta" (exact) might imply that we are counting 
exact matches, not substrings.

 However, without knowing the structure, it is difficult.

 Let's assume the following:

 We are to count the records that have the exact string "Generacion Z" or 
"Frankenstein" in the text, and then compute the proportion of each.

 But wait, the question says "frente a", meaning we are to compare the 
two. So we need to count:

   - Number of records with "Generacion Z"
   - Number of records with "Frankenstein"

 Then, we can compute the percentage of each relative to the total 
records.

 However, note: a record might contain both? Then it would be counted in 
both. But the question does not specify if we are to consider each record 
only once or not.

 Since the question is about the proportion of records for each category, 
we should count each record separately for each category.

 But the total records would be the same for both percentages, so we can 
compute:

   percentage_generacion_z = (count_generacion_z / total_records) * 100
   percentage_frankenstein = (count_frankenstein / total_records) * 10

 However, note: the question asks for the proportion exacta (exact) of 
each category. We are to show the percentage of each.

 But the problem does not specify if the categories are mutually 
exclusive. We are counting independently.

 Steps:

 1. Read the CSV file.
 2. We don't know the column, so we have to look for a column that might 
contain the text. Let's assume there is a column named 'text' or 
'content'. If not, we might have to look for the first column that has 
text.

 Alternatively, we can search for the two strings in every column? That 
would be inefficient.

 Another possibility: the dataset might have a column named 'category' and 
we use that.

 Since we don't know, we can try:

   - Look for a column that has the string "Generacion Z" or 
"Frankenstein" in the header or in the data.

 But without knowing the dataset, it's hard.

 Let's assume we are to look for the two strings in the entire dataset, 
meaning we consider every cell in every row and every column.

 However, that would be inefficient and might not be what the user 
intended.

 Alternatively, we can ask the user for the column name, but we are to 
provide a solution.

 We must make an assumption.

 Let's assume that the categories are in a column named 'category'. We 
will look for that column.

 If it doesn't exist, we look for a column named 'text' or 'content'.

 If that doesn't exist, we look for the first column that has text 
(non-empty string) and use that.

 But note: the dataset might be large, so we don't want to search in every 
cell if we don't have to.

 Alternatively, we can look for the column that has the word "category" in 
the header.

 However, the problem does not specify.

 Since the problem is ambiguous, I will provide two solutions:

 Solution 1: Assume the categories are in a column named 'category'.

 Solution 2: Assume the categories are in the text of the record (so we 
look in every cell).

 But note: the user might have provided the dataset and we are to compute 
based on the entire dataset.

 Let me re-read the question: "basado en el archivo, ¿Cuál es la 
proporción exacta de registros sobre ...". The word "registros" (records) 
and the context of the dataset.

 Since the dataset is named 'datasetTexto.csv', it might be that the text 
is in a column named 'text'.

 We'll try:

   - Look for a column named 'category'
   - Then 'text'
   - Then 'content'
   - Then the first column that has text (if none of the above)

 If we cannot find a column, then we cannot proceed.

 However, we are to write code that works for the given dataset.

 Since we don't have the dataset, we must write a general code that can 
handle different column names.

 But note: the problem says "en el dataset", so we are to use the dataset 
provided.

 We are not given the dataset, so we cannot run the code.

 We must write a function that can be used.

 Let's write a function that:

   - Tries to find a column named 'category'
   - Then 'text'
   - Then 'content'
   - Then looks for the first column that has text (non-empty) and uses 
that.

 Then, in that column, we count the occurrences of the exact string 
"Generacion Z" and "Frankenstein".

 But note: the string might appear in different cases? The question says 
"exacta", so we assume case-sensitive.

 However, in Spanish, the category names are typically in title case. We 
assume the dataset uses the exact string.

 Steps in the function:

  1. Read the CSV file.
  2. Check if there is a column named 'category'. If yes, use that column.
  3. Else, check for 'text' and 'content'.
  4. Else, look for the first column that has text (non-empty) and use 
that.

  5. In that column, count the number of rows where the string is exactly 
"Generacion Z" and exactly "Frankenstein".

  6. Compute the total number of records (rows) that have at least one of 
these two? No, the total records is the entire dataset.

  7. Then, the proportion for "Generacion Z" is (count_generacion_z / 
total_records) * 100
     Similarly for "Frankenstein".

  8. Print or return the two percentages.

 However, note: the question asks for the proportion of each category, so 
we are to report two percentages.

 But note: the total records is the same for both, so we can compute.

 But wait: what if the dataset has no records? Then we cannot compute.

 We assume the dataset has at least one record.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

 However, note: the problem does not specify the CSV library to use. We'll 
use pandas because it can handle CSV easily.

 But note: the problem does not specify the environment. We assume we can 
use pandas.

 Alternatively, we can use the built-in csv module, but that would be more 
code.

 Since the problem is about a dataset, and we are to compute, we'll use 
pandas.

 But note: the problem does not specify that we can use pandas. However, 
in many data science contexts, pandas is available.

 Alternatively, we can use the built-in csv module to read the file and 
then process.

 Let's do it with the built-in csv module to avoid external dependencies.

 Steps with csv module:

   - Open the file.
   - Read the header to find the column we want.
   - Then, for each row, check the value in that column.

 But note: the dataset might be large, so we don't want to read the entire 
file into memory if we are using the csv module.

 However, the problem does not specify the size.

 We'll write the code accordingly.

 Let's assume the following:

   We are to look for the two strings in the entire dataset, meaning we 
consider every cell? Or just one column?

 Since the question says "registros sobre", it means the record (row) is 
about the topic. So we are to look in one column (the category column) or 
in the entire row? 

 The word "sobre" (about) typically refers to the content of the record. 
So if we are using a category column, then we look in that column. If we 
are using the text, then we look in the text column.

 We are to look in a single column (the one we found) for the exact 
string.

 We are not to look in every cell of the row.

 So, we are to look in the column we found (the category column) for the 
exact string.

 Steps:

  1. Read the CSV file and store the header.
  2. Try to find a column named 'category'. If found, use that column.
  3. Else, try 'text', then 'content'.
  4. Else, find the first column that has text (non-empty) and use that.

  5. Count the number of rows in that column that have the exact string 
"Generacion Z" and "Frankenstein".

  6. Compute the percentages.

 But note: what if the column we found is not the one with the categories? 
Then we might get wrong counts.

 We are making an assumption.

 We'll write the code accordingly.

 Let's code accordingly.

 However, note: the problem does not specify the file encoding. We assume 
it's UTF-8.

 We'll use the built-in csv module.

 Steps:

   import csv

   filename = '/Downloads/datasetTexto.csv'

   with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        headers = next(reader)   # Read the header

   Then, we look for the column index for the column we want.

   Then, we read the rest of the rows.

   We count:

        count_z = 0
        count_frankenstein = 0
        total_records = 0

        for row in reader:
            if total_records == 0:
                # We already read the header, so we are now at the first 
data row.
                # But note: the reader is now at the next row, so we need 
to start counting from the first data row.
                total_records = len(row)
            else:
                # We are in the data rows, but note: the row might have 
more columns than the header? We assume the same number.
                # We get the value in the column we found (say, col_index)
                value = row[col_index]
                if value == "Generacion Z":
                    count_z += 1
                elif value == "Frankenstein":
                    count_frankenstein += 1

        total_records = total_records   # But wait, we set total_records 
to the length of the first row, but we should count the rows.

   Actually, we should count the rows (each row is one record). We are 
counting the rows that have the category.

   But note: we are counting the rows that have the category, so the 
total_records is the total number of rows.

   We can do:

        total_records = 0
        count_z = 0
        count_frankenstein = 0

        with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            reader = csv.reader(f)
            headers = next(reader)
            # Find the column index
            col_index = None
            for i, header in enumerate(headers):
                if header == 'category':
                    col_index = i
                    break
            if col_index is None:
                for i, header in enumerate(headers):
                    if header == 'text':
                        col_index = i
                        break
            if col_index is None:
                for i, header in enumerate(headers):
                    if header == 'content':
                        col_index = i
                        break
            if col_index is None:
                # Find the first column that has text (non-empty) in the 
header
                for i, header in enumerate(headers):
                    if header and header.strip():
                        col_index = i
                        break

            # Now, read the rows
            for row in reader:
                total_records += 1
                if col_index is None or col_index >= len(row):
                    # Skip if the column doesn't exist or the row doesn't 
have that column
                    continue
                value = row[col_index]
                if value == "Generacion Z":
                    count_z += 1
                elif value == "Frankenstein":
                    count_frankenstein += 1

   Then, compute the percentages.

   But note: what if the column index is found but the row doesn't have 
that column? We skip.

   Then:

        percentage_z = (count_z / total_records) * 100
        percentage_frankenstein = (count_frankenstein / total_records) * 
100

   However, note: the total_records includes every row that we read. We 
skipped rows without the column, so we must be cautious.

   Alternatively, we can count only the rows that have the column and then 
use that as the base? But the problem says the proportion of records 
(rows) that have the category.

   We are counting the rows that have the category, and the total_records 
is the total rows we read (with the column present). But if we skip rows 
without the column, then the total_records is not the total rows, but the 
rows with the column.

   We want the proportion of all records (rows) that have the category, 
regardless of the column. But note: we are only looking at the rows that 
have the column.

   Actually, the problem does not specify if the category is in every row. 
We assume the column we found is present in every row.

   But if not, then we cannot count the category for that row.

   We are to count the records that have the category, so we count the 
rows that have the column and the value equals the string.
